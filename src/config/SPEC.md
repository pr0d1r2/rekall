# SPEC

## §G GOAL

`rekall.toml`: the two scopes, the per-key merge, and the union that is the exception to it.

## §N NAV

rel|path|lens
up|.|-
up|src|the CRATE, federated one node per module: what each verb & each subsystem ! hold true
self|src/config|`rekall.toml`: the two scopes, the per-key merge, and the union that is the exception to it.
sib|src/apply|EXECUTING an extraction: the artifact written, the source span deleted, the pointer left in its place, and the ledger row that makes it reversible.
sib|src/catch|the SECOND intake: a transcript read tolerantly, a human turn recognised, a candidate proposed.
sib|src/check|THE GATE over extractions: a rule with no runner, a skill with no trigger or no refusal clause, an orphan artifact, a span that should have gone.
sib|src/classify|the VERDICT: signals, their weights, the deadband, and class x sharpness.
sib|src/cli|the VERB SURFACE: dispatch, argument parsing, the two output formats, and the exit codes.
sib|src/corpus|REACHING the files: roots x globs, the walk, symlink loops, and what could not be read.
sib|src/hook|the HARNESS ADAPTER: a payload read tolerantly, a decision written, the fire counter, and the runner fired at the trigger point.
sib|src/init|THE COLD START: detecting roots and writing a project config without clobbering one.
sib|src/issue|ISSUING a proven extraction to the loop that tends it: the portable copy written out, the local copy left standing, and the ledger row that says which stage it is in.
sib|src/ledger|THE STORE: extracted rows, candidate rows, fire counts, and prefix lookup.
sib|src/log|READING the ledger back: fire counts, net reclaim, and what never fired.
sib|src/plan|the extraction DIFF: which span goes, which artifact arrives, what wiring is named, and the corpus fingerprint that makes it stale.
sib|src/recall|WHICH situational skills load in a given situation.
sib|src/revert|REVERSING one extraction verbatim from what the ledger kept.
sib|src/runner|EXECUTING a rule's script under a CPU bound, and reporting what it said.
sib|src/scan|the INVENTORY: one row per statement, filtered, sorted, report-only.
sib|src/show|ONE statement argued in full: every signal that fired and what it was worth.
sib|src/statement|PROSE INTO STATEMENTS: block splitting, normalisation, the path-scoped id, and the line span.
sib|src/tokens|DELEGATING every count to `itok`, and the per-call scratch that keeps concurrent counts apart.
sib|src/trigger|the fenced `rekall` BLOCK: its keys, how they combine, and the refusal clause that wins.

## §V INVARIANTS

WHAT MUST STAY TRUE HERE, one line each, numbered from the first id. Delete this line.
V36: a TRACKED config names only what the REPO owns. A USER-scope root in `./rekall.toml` hard-codes one developer's home into every checkout & drags private memory into a measurement meant to be reproducible by anyone who clones it. Nothing is lost: roots UNION across scopes (§I), which is the entire reason two scopes exist.
